A Node.js Sailthru API Wrapper
==============================
Author: Angelo DiNardi (angelo@dinardi.name)

Overview
--------
This library is horribly incomplete and only supports the 'send' operation presently.
It is also completely devoid of documentation at the moment.

Requirements
------------
This library depends on the Sequencer project (http://github.com/adinardi/sequencer) and hashlib (http://github.com/brainfucker/hashlib).

Hashlib is expected to be in the node.js library path. Sequencer is included as a git submodule of this project.
